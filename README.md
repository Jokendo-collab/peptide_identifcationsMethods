## Comparison of different search engines for the identification of proteins in complex clinical samples

* Unbiased comparisons between search programs to determine which performs best are challenging and currently there is no standard database search engine that is accepted universally within the proteomics community.
* Some search parameters should be matched and others can invalidate comparisons if they are matched. This has resulted in consistency making the comparison of different database search engines a great challenge.
* Consistent data processing is essential. This will enable ease of comparison of different results from different studies of core facilities
